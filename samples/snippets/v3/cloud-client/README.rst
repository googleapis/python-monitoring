Google Stackdriver Monitoring API Python Samples
===============================================================================

This directory contains samples for Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Stackdriver Monitoring collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), hosted uptime probes, application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch
 and many others. Stackdriver ingests that data and generates insights
 via dashboards, charts, and alerts.
