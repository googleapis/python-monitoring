      partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation operation.
      Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each of
      the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly
      one subset. The ``cross_series_reducer`` is applied to each subset of
      time series. It is not possible to reduce across different resource
      types, so this field implicitly contains ``resource.type``. Fields not

              - `identifier_case`

          ``identifier_case`` refers to which option in the identifier oneof is
          populated. For example, the filter ``identifier_case = "CUSTOM"`` would
          match all services with a value for the ``custom`` field. Valid options
          are "CUSTOM", "APP_ENGINE", "CLOUD_ENDPOINTS", and "CLUSTER_ISTIO".
          ALIGN_MIN (int): The protocol for the ``DeleteAlertPolicy`` request.

          ALIGN_SUM (int): A `filter <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/filters>`__
          that identifies which time series should be compared with the threshold.

          The filter is similar to the one that is specified in the
          ```ListTimeSeries``
          request <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.timeSeries/list>`__
          (that call is useful to verify the time series that will be retrieved /
          processed) and must specify the metric type and optionally may contain
          restrictions on resource type, resource labels, and metric labels. This
          field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters in length.
          ALIGN_STDDEV (int): The ``VerifyNotificationChannel`` request.
          ALIGN_COUNT_TRUE (int): Deprecated. Please use the MetricDescriptor.launch_stage instead.
          The launch stage of the metric definition.
          ALIGN_COUNT_FALSE (int): Specifies the alignment of data points in individual time series as
          well as how to combine the retrieved time series together (such as when
          aggregating multiple streams on each resource to a single stream for
          each resource or when aggregating streams across all members of a group
          of resrouces). Multiple aggregations are applied in the order specified.

          This field is similar to the one in the ```ListTimeSeries``
          request <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.timeSeries/list>`__.
          It is advisable to use the ``ListTimeSeries`` method when debugging this
          field.
          ALIGN_FRACTION_TRUE (int): Specifies an exponential sequence of buckets that have a width that
          is proportional to the value of the lower bound. Each bucket represents
          a constant relative uncertainty on a specific value in the bucket.

          There are ``num_finite_buckets + 2`` (= N) buckets. Bucket ``i`` has the
          following boundaries:

          ::

             Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1):     scale * (growth_factor ^ i).
             Lower bound (1 <= i < N):       scale * (growth_factor ^ (i - 1)).

          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_95 (int): The fraction of service that must be good in order for this
          objective to be met. ``0 < goal <= 0.999``.
          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_50 (int): Whether the message is an automatically generated map entry type for
          the maps field.

          For maps fields: map<KeyType, ValueType> map_field = 1; The parsed
          descriptor looks like: message MapFieldEntry { option map_entry = true;
          optional KeyType key = 1; optional ValueType value = 2; } repeated
          MapFieldEntry map_field = 1;

          Implementations may choose not to generate the map_entry=true message,
          but use a native map in the target language to hold the keys and values.
          The reflection APIs in such implementations still need to work as if the
          field is a repeated message field.

          NOTE: Do not set the option in .proto files. Always use the maps syntax
          instead. The option should only be implicitly set by the proto compiler
          parser.
          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_05 (int): A `filter <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/filters>`__
          that identifies a time series that should be used as the denominator of
          a ratio that will be compared with the threshold. If a
          ``denominator_filter`` is specified, the time series specified by the
          ``filter`` field will be used as the numerator.

          The filter must specify the metric type and optionally may contain
          restrictions on resource type, resource labels, and metric labels. This
          field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters in length.
          ALIGN_PERCENT_CHANGE (int): The GCP zone the Uptime check should egress from. Only respected for

          Only ``COMPARISON_LT`` and ``COMPARISON_GT`` are supported currently.

          ``name`` field in the conditions of the requested alerting policy.
          Stackdriver Monitoring creates the condition identifiers and includes

          When calling the ``alertPolicies.update`` method to update a policy,
